A PHP Application Starter, Based on CodeIgniter
===============================================

Requirements
------------

PHP 5.2.4 (officially, actually the platform works on PHP 5.2.0), Apache 2.2 - 2.4.
For database support seek information within CodeIgniter 3.0-dev documentation.

Installation
------------

Download source and place it on your web-server within its document root or within a sub-folder.
Make the folder platform/writable to be writable. It is to contain CodeIgniter's cache, logs and other things that you might add.
Open the site with a browser on an address like this: http://localhost/starter-public-edition-3/www/

On your web-server you may move one level up the content of the folder www, so the segment www from the address to disappear.
Also you can move the folder platform to a folder outside the document root of the web server for increased security.
After such a rearangement open the file config.php (www/config.php before rearrangement), find the setting $PLATFORMPATH and change this path accordingly.
Don't forget to check platform/writable folder, it should be writable.

Have a look at the files .htaccess and robots.txt and adjust them for your site.
The PHP configuration files of the application you may find at platform/application/config/ folder.

The platform auto-detects its base URL address nevertheless its public part is on the document root of the web-server or not.
I don't expect you to be forced to set it up manually within platform/application/config/config.php.
